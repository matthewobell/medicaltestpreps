        Medical Test Prep was developed by an Associate Professor and Minimally Invasive Surgeon to help
        residents in all surgical subspecialties pass their Fundamental of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) written
        component and Essentials in Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery (EMIGS) cognitive examination.

        Medical Test Prep is not affiliated with the FLS program, SAGES, AAGL, the American College of Surgeons (ACS)
        or the EMIGS program.
