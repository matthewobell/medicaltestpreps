      <p>Medical Test Prep, LLC is a physician-led medical education company committed to empowering residents and attending physicians through high-yield, app-based learning tools. Founded by a board-certified physician, a skilled tech team, and part-time legal support, our mission is to promote lifelong learning and board success across a wide range of specialties.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We create short, focused question bank exams that fit seamlessly into the rare gaps in a busy physician's schedule. Our approach is grounded in educational research: brief, frequent bursts of learning outperform cramming and foster deeper, longer-lasting knowledge retention.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>These tools are designed not only to help physicians succeed on high-stakes exams, but also to strengthen clinical excellence throughout their careers. We believe that continuous learning is the foundation of exceptional patient care.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Team</h2>
      <p>Our team combines medical expertise with cutting-edge technology to deliver learning experiences that are both effective and engaging. We understand the unique challenges facing medical professionals and have designed our platform specifically to address these needs.</p>
      
      <h3>Why We Started Medical Test Prep</h3>
      <p>The journey of medical education doesn't end with residency. Board certifications, continuing education requirements, and the constant evolution of medical knowledge require ongoing study. We recognized that traditional study methods often don't fit into the demanding schedules of practicing physicians.</p>
      
      <p>Our platform bridges this gap by providing bite-sized, high-impact learning sessions that can be completed during brief moments throughout the day - whether between patients, during a short break, or while commuting.</p>
      
      <p>Best of luck as you continue your journey in medicine â€” we're here to help!</p>
