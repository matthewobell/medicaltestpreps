      <p>Medical Test Prep, LLC is a physician-led medical education company committed to empowering residents and attending physicians through high-yield, app-based learning tools. Founded by a board-certified physician, a skilled tech team, and part-time legal support, our mission is to promote lifelong learning and board success across a wide range of specialties.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We create short, focused question bank exams that fit seamlessly into the rare gaps in a busy physician's schedule. Our approach is grounded in educational research: brief, frequent bursts of learning outperform cramming and foster deeper, longer-lasting knowledge retention. These tools are designed not only to help physicians succeed on high-stakes exams, but also to strengthen clinical excellence throughout their careers.</p>
        
      <p>Best of luck as you continue your journey in medicine â€” we're here to help!</p>
