      <p class="mission-text">
        We create short, focused question bank exams that fit seamlessly into the rare gaps in a busy physician's schedule.
      </p>
      <p class="mission-text">
        Our approach is grounded in educational research: brief, frequent bursts of learning outperform cramming and foster deeper, longer-lasting knowledge retention. These tools are designed not only to help physicians succeed on high-stakes exams, but also to strengthen clinical excellence throughout their careers.
