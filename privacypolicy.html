      <p class="page-text"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 1, 2026</p>

      <p class="page-text">
        Medical Test Prep, LLC ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Medical Test Prep mobile
        application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how
        we use it, how we may share or license it, and your choices regarding your information.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        Please read this policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the practices described
        here. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
      </p>

        <strong>1.2 Account Information (Optional)</strong><br />
        If you choose to create an account (for example, by signing in with an email address),
        we collect your email address and any profile details you voluntarily provide, such as
        your name, institution, specialty, or graduation year. Account creation is optional, and
        many features are available without an account.
      </p>

      <p class="page-text">
        <strong>1.3 Support Communications</strong><br />

        <strong>1.4 Diagnostics and Stability Data</strong><br />
        We may receive anonymized diagnostic or crash information through device or operating
        system settings to help improve performance and reliability. This data is governed by
        your device platform's privacy controls (Apple iOS or Android) and is not linked to your
        account.
      </p>

      <!-- 2 -->
      <h2 class="page-subheading">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p class="page-text">We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>

      <!-- 3 -->
      <h2 class="page-subheading">3. Data Linked to You</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        Learning activity and usage analytics may be associated with a device identifier or an
        anonymous app session identifier. If you sign in with an account, some data may also be
        associated with your account and email address.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        We do not collect personal content outside the App, such as your contacts, photos,
        messages, or activity on other apps or websites. We do not use third-party advertising
        SDKs and we do not track you across other companies' apps or websites.
      </p>

      <!-- 4 -->
      <h2 class="page-subheading">4. Aggregate Data, Research, and Commercial Data Partnerships</h2>

      <p class="page-text">
        We may use anonymized, aggregate data derived from App usage for research, benchmarking,
        and commercial data partnership purposes. This section describes those practices in full.
      </p>

      <p class="page-text">
        <strong>4.1 What "Aggregate, Anonymized Data" Means</strong><br />
        Aggregate, anonymized data refers to information that has been de-identified and combined
        across many users so that no individual user can reasonably be identified. Examples
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="page-text">
        <li>Overall performance trends across all users on specific topics or question categories</li>
        <li>Average study time and session frequency across the user base</li>
        <li>Specialty and geographic distribution of users in aggregate</li>
        <li>Knowledge gap patterns by exam type or surgical subspecialty</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="page-text">
        We never sell or share data in a form that identifies, or could reasonably identify, any
        individual user.
      </p>

      <p class="page-text">
        <strong>4.2 How We May Use or License Aggregate Data</strong><br />
        We may use or license aggregate, anonymized data for the following commercial purposes:
      </p>
      <ul class="page-text">
        <li><strong>Institutional Benchmarking and Residency Program Analytics:</strong> We may provide residency programs, medical schools, teaching hospitals, and graduate medical education offices with aggregate, anonymized performance and engagement data to help them understand curriculum gaps and benchmark their cohorts against national trends. Individual residents are never identifiable in these reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Device and Pharmaceutical Market Research:</strong> We may provide medical device manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and their research partners with aggregate, anonymized reports on study behavior, knowledge gaps, specialty distribution, and engagement trends relevant to surgical education. These reports do not include individual user data.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic and Clinical Research:</strong> We may license aggregate, anonymized datasets to academic researchers, medical schools, and research institutions studying medical education, surgical training effectiveness, or physician learning patterns. Any research partnerships involving our data will be governed by appropriate data use agreements.</li>
        <li><strong>Workforce and Pipeline Intelligence:</strong> We may provide healthcare systems, hospital networks, and physician workforce planning organizations with aggregate, anonymized data on the geographic distribution, specialty breakdown, and exam readiness trends of our user base to support workforce planning and pipeline analysis.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="page-text">
        <strong>4.3 What We Will Never Do</strong><br />
        Regardless of any commercial arrangement, we make the following commitments:
      </p>
      <ul class="page-text">
        <li>We will never sell or share data that identifies, or could reasonably identify, any individual user</li>
        <li>We will never share individual quiz scores, performance records, or study history with any third party in a form linked to a specific person</li>
        <li>We will never provide any sponsor, research partner, or data licensee with access to raw, user-level data</li>
        <li>We will never use individual learning performance data to evaluate a physician's clinical competency or share such information with licensing bodies, employers, or credentialing organizations</li>
        <li>Sponsored content selection is not based on individual user profiling or behavioral targeting</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- 5 -->
      <h2 class="page-subheading">5. Sponsored and Promotional Content</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        The App is free to users and is supported by sponsorships from medical device
        manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and other organizations with a legitimate
        educational interest in reaching medical trainees and professionals.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        Sponsored content within the App may include branded educational materials,
        informational resources, or promotional messaging. All sponsored content is clearly
        identified as sponsored or promotional so you always know when content is supported by
        a third party.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        Sponsored content is selected based on its relevance to surgical education and the
        general characteristics of our user base. We do not use individual behavioral profiles,
        quiz performance, or personal study data to target sponsored content to specific users.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        Sponsored content does not influence quiz questions, answer keys, explanations, scoring,
        or any other educational content in the App. Medical Test Prep, LLC does not endorse
        the products or services of any sponsor.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        You are not required to interact with sponsored content in order to use the core
        educational features of the App.
      </p>

      <!-- 6 -->
      <h2 class="page-subheading">6. Analytics and Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        We use Firebase Analytics (provided by Google) to collect anonymized usage data to help
        us understand how users interact with the App and to improve its performance. Firebase
        Analytics data is processed in accordance with Google's privacy policies. We do not use
        third-party advertising SDKs.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        Data collected through Firebase Analytics may be stored in Google's BigQuery
        infrastructure as part of our internal analytics pipeline. This data is used solely for
        internal analysis and to generate the aggregate, anonymized insights described in
        Section 4.
      </p>

      <!-- 7 -->
      <h2 class="page-subheading">7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        We retain account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to
        provide the App's services. If you delete your account, we will remove your personal
        information from our active systems within a reasonable period, subject to legal
        obligations.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        Aggregate, anonymized data derived from your usage may be retained indefinitely as it
        does not contain information that identifies you.
      </p>

      <!-- 8 -->
      <h2 class="page-subheading">8. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        The App is intended for medical trainees and professionals and is not directed toward
        children under 13 (or the minimum age required by applicable law). We do not knowingly
        collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child under 13 has
        provided us with personal information, we will delete it promptly.
      </p>

      <!-- 9 -->
      <h2 class="page-subheading">9. Data Security</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we
        collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures
        include encryption of data in transit, secure cloud infrastructure, and access controls.
      </p>
      <p class="page-text">
        No system is completely secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your
        information, and we encourage you to use a strong, unique password for your account.
      </p>

      <!-- 10 -->
      <h2 class="page-subheading">10. Your Choices</h2>
      <p class="page-text">You have the following choices regarding your information:</p>
      <ul class="page-text">
        <li>Reset or delete local study data using in-app options in the Settings menu</li>
        <li>Delete your account by contacting us at <a href="mailto:admin@medicaltestprep.org">admin@medicaltestprep.org</a> — we will remove your personal account data from our active systems</li>
        <li>Uninstall the App to remove locally stored data from your device</li>
        <li>Choose whether to create an account or use the App without signing in</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="page-text">
        Please note that even if you delete your account, aggregate, anonymized data derived
        from your prior usage may be retained as it cannot be linked back to you individually.
      </p>

      <!-- 11 -->
      <h2 class="page-subheading">11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p class="page-text">
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices
        or applicable law. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date
        at the top of this policy and may provide additional notice within the App. Your
        continued use of the App after any update constitutes your acceptance of the revised
        policy.
