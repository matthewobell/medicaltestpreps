      <p class="page-text">
        Medical Test Prep, LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”) operates the EMIGS Prep mobile
        application (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains what information we
        collect, how it is used, and your choices.
      </p>

      <h2 class="page-heading" style="font-size:28px;">Information We Collect</h2>

      <p class="page-text">
        <strong>Learning and usage data:</strong><br />
        The App collects information about how you use learning features, such as quiz
        attempts, selected answers, scores, progress, flashcard interactions, study
        behavior, and feature usage.
      </p>

      <p class="page-text">
        This information is primarily stored on your device. In limited cases, certain
        usage or diagnostic data may be transmitted in a privacy-preserving way to help
        operate, maintain, and improve the App.
      </p>

      <p class="page-text">
        <strong>Account information (optional):</strong><br />
        Some features may allow or require account creation, such as email sign-in or

      <p class="page-text">
        <strong>Diagnostics and stability data:</strong><br />
        We may receive anonymized diagnostic or crash information (for example, through
        device or operating system settings) to help improve performance and
        reliability. This data is governed by your device platform’s privacy controls.
      </p>
